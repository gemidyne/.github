## We are Gemidyne 

An online collective brought together in 2013. We started out in the game modding scene, and have expanded into general software & web development. Our goal is to create high quality pieces of software with great care and attention to detail.

Our projects: 
- [Nico Nico Niinfected!](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1132648289) - a Left 4 Dead 2 game mod, replacing all common infected with Nico Yazawa from "Love Live! School idol project"
- [Microgames in TF2](https://github.com/gemidyne/microtf2) - a Team Fortress 2 custom gamemode built on SourceMod, featuring rapid-fire microgames which players need to complete in order to score points.
- [SteamServerBrowser.com](https://www.steamserverbrowser.com/) - a modern online Steam game server browser, with filters & analytics.
- [Tsukuru Source Engine Tool](https://www.gemidyne.com/projects/tsukuru) - a Source Engine utilty for compiling BSPs, SourceMod plugins, and more
